Yes sir, you need to create a database server for Faculty Performance in the college database, and run the schema.sql file to generate all the required tables there.

After that, we will need the database connection details to connect the application to the database server:
- Database host/URL
- Database name
- Username
- Password
- Port

This is the GitHub repository of the application:
